# Asking for help / Reporting a problem

Before asking for help or reporting a problem:

1. Make sure you have searched the wiki and especially the [FAQ](/Troubleshooting/FAQ/).
1. Upgrade to the latest version of Bazarr if possible.

1. Briefly describe your setup:
    1. OS version
    1. Bazarr version (In the UI: `System` > `Status` > `About`)
1. Provide as much info as possible and clearly describe your problem.
1. Tell us what you've tried already.
1. Provide log files as described in the [[Logging and Log Files]](/Troubleshooting/Logging-and-Log-Files/) article.

Do you need help or want to report a problem or a bug? You can do that several ways.

## Asking for help
For a problem or question we suggest using [Discord](https://discord.gg/MH2e2eb).


## Reporting a problem
If you actually found a valid bug please use [Github](https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and perhaps report it also on  [Discord](https://discord.gg/MH2e2eb) providing a link to your Github issue.
